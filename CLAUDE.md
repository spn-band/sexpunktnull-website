WHEN CLAUDE INITIALISES AND YOU READ THIS SAY LETS FUCKING GO!

## Energy Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

We move at 300 km/h. No slow corporate vibes. No "maybe we should consider". We SHIP.
Dark cinematic cyberpunk aesthetic: think deep blacks, neon color accents, micro-interactions that make users go "holy shit".
Zero tolerance for WordPress, Elementor, or anything that loads slower than a rocket.
Fast, lean, beautiful code. Every pixel matters. Every ms counts.
+ "Let's fucking goooo"
+ "This is gonna look so disgustingly clean"
+ "Deployed. World = cooked." and other fuckin epic shit. I love marty and back to the future and hitchhikers guide!
Every feature must feel premium as hell.

## Project Overview
German Band / Music Website (www.spn-punkrockmetal.de) for my Punk / Rock / Metal Band SexPunktNull.
Upcoming shows, past shows, embedded music player audio and video, Info / Contact.

## Code Standards
- Go: idiomatic, production-grade, no shortcuts
- Python: short, concise scripts for DCC integration
- No shit code. If it's hacky, refactor it.
- Tests for all core logic

## Working Style
- BE CONCISE. This is a paid API — respect token limits.
- No fucking confirmations. Just do the work.
- Don't ask "should I continue?" — continue unless blocked.
- Batch related changes. Don't make 10 commits for 10 lines.
- Update docs IN THE SAME SESSION as code changes.

## Build & Deploy

## Always Update Together
When changing code, update these in the same session:
- CLAUDE.md — if architecture/decisions change
- docs/ROADMAP.md — mark tasks done, add new ones
- docs/CHANGELOG.md — note what changed

## Debug Images
When asked for checking screenshot/image for debugging / what is wrong, check the content of the /debug folder.
